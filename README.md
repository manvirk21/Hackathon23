# Hackathon23

This is a project created for the KU Hackathon 2023 Accessibility track.
I created this to help people understand legal documents better. 
Unless you are a lawyer, legal jargon doesn't make a lot of sense. This is even harder for immigrants, people whose first language isn't English, and people with certain disabilities.
This program will take the difficult terms and convert them to easier to understand words. The output result is helpful for everyone.
